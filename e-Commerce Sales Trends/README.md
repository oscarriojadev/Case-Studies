# E-Commerce Sales Trends Analysis

A Python tool for analyzing and forecasting e-commerce sales time series data using ARIMA modeling and decomposition techniques.

## Overview

This tool provides functionality to analyze historical e-commerce sales data and make forecasts for future periods. It implements time series analysis techniques including:

- Time series visualization
- Seasonal decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual)
- Stationarity testing
- Autocorrelation analysis
- ARIMA modeling and forecasting
- Model evaluation

## üß† Why ARIMA?

The **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model was chosen for this e-commerce sales forecasting task for the following reasons:

### ‚úÖ Time Series Nature of the Problem
E-commerce sales data are typically sequential and time-dependent, which makes ARIMA a natural choice. ARIMA is specifically designed for time series forecasting and excels in capturing both trend and seasonality components of the data.

### ‚úÖ Incorporates Past Information
ARIMA models use lagged values (auto-regression) and previous forecast errors (moving average) to predict future values. This allows it to make use of past sales trends to forecast future sales, which is crucial in e-commerce sales forecasting.

### ‚úÖ Flexibility and Simplicity
ARIMA is relatively simple and interpretable compared to more complex models like machine learning techniques. It requires minimal input and can be effectively tuned with three hyperparameters: **p** (AR), **d** (differencing), and **q** (MA). Additionally, it works well even with non-stationary data after differencing.

### ‚úÖ Seasonal Decomposition
The ARIMA model can handle trends and seasonality if the correct seasonal differencing is applied. With seasonal decomposition, it can split the time series into its underlying components: trend, seasonality, and residuals, which helps in both forecasting and understanding underlying patterns.

## üîç Model Comparison: Why ARIMA Over Other Models?

Several other models could be used for forecasting time series data, such as **Exponential Smoothing**, **Prophet**, and **Machine Learning models**. However, ARIMA offers a good balance of simplicity, interpretability, and accuracy for our needs.

| **Model**             | **Accuracy**   | **Handling Seasonality** | **Complexity**        | **Interpretability** | **Comments**                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARIMA**             | ‚úÖ High        | ‚úÖ Yes (via seasonal ARIMA) | ‚öôÔ∏è Low                | ‚úÖ High              | Ideal for time series with clear trends and seasonality. Simple to use. |
| **Exponential Smoothing** | üü° Medium     | ‚úÖ Yes (Holt-Winters)     | ‚öôÔ∏è Medium             | üü° Moderate          | Works well for smooth trends but lacks the flexibility of ARIMA in handling residuals. |
| **Prophet**           | ‚úÖ High        | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚öôÔ∏è Medium             | üü° Moderate          | Excellent for daily/weekly seasonal data, but more complex to tune. |
| **Machine Learning (e.g., XGBoost)** | üü° Medium  | ‚ùå Not inherently suited  | ‚öôÔ∏è High               | üî¥ Low               | Great for non-linear data, but requires extensive feature engineering and may not perform as well for strictly time-dependent trends. |

## üéØ Summary

Given the nature of e-commerce sales data, which exhibit clear trends and seasonal patterns, **ARIMA** was chosen because:

- It effectively captures trends and seasonality, critical for sales forecasting.
- The model is relatively simple to tune and interpret.
- ARIMA's ability to use historical values and past forecast errors aligns well with how sales data evolve over time.

For more complex datasets or cases with multiple seasonalities and holidays, **Prophet** could be a better alternative, though it requires more tuning. Additionally, machine learning models like **XGBoost** might be considered if the relationships between features and sales become more complex.

In conclusion, ARIMA provides a solid, interpretable solution for forecasting e-commerce sales in this case, with strong performance and minimal preprocessing requirements.


## Requirements

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodels
scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your time series data as a CSV file with at least a 'date' column and a numeric value column
2. Modify the `main()` function in `ecommerce_sales_trends.py` with your file path
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python ecommerce_sales_trends.py
   ```

## Function Reference

### `load_data(file_path)`
Loads time series data from a CSV file with proper date parsing.

### `plot_time_series(data, title='Time Series Data')`
Visualizes the time series data with customizable title.

### `decompose_time_series(data, model='additive', period=None)`
Decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

### `test_stationarity(data)`
Tests if the time series is stationary using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.

### `plot_acf_pacf(data, lags=None)`

### `forecast_arima(fitted_model, steps=10)`
Forecasts future values using a fitted ARIMA model.

### `evaluate_arima_model(fitted_model, data)`
Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### `plot_forecast(data, forecast, title='Forecast')`
Visualizes actual data alongside forecasted values.

## Example

```python

# Visualize the time series
plot_time_series(data)

# Decompose into trend, seasonal, and residual components
decomposition = decompose_time_series(data, model='additive', period=12)

# Check if the time series is stationary
stationarity_result = test_stationarity(data)

# Analyze autocorrelation patterns
plot_acf_pacf(data, lags=20)

# Fit an ARIMA model
fitted_model = fit_arima_model(data, order=(1, 1, 1))

# Make forecasts
forecast_values = forecast_arima(fitted_model, steps=10)
print('Forecasted Values:', forecast_values)

# Evaluate model performance
mse, rmse = evaluate_arima_model(fitted_model, data)

# Visualize forecasts
plot_forecast(data, forecast_values, title='ARIMA Forecast')
