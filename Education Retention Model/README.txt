# Case Study: Predicting Student Retention Using Machine Learning

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Student retention is a critical challenge for educational institutions. High dropout rates impact institutional reputation, funding, and student outcomes. This case study presents a machine learning (ML) model designed to predict student retention, enabling early identification of at-risk students and targeted interventions.

## 2. OBJECTIVES
- ✅ Develop a predictive model to classify students as "retained" or "at-risk"
- 🔍 Identify key factors influencing retention
- 🧩 Provide actionable insights for educators to improve student support programs

## 3. METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Data Preparation
**Dataset**:
- Contains student records with features: GPA, attendance, socio-economic status, extracurricular participation
- Target variable: `Retention` (1 = retained, 0 = at-risk)

**Preprocessing**:
- Features standardized using `StandardScaler`
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing

### 3.2 Model Selection
**Algorithm**: `RandomForestClassifier`
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Provides feature importance scores

### 3.3 Evaluation Metrics
- 📊 Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- 📉 Confusion matrix
- 📄 Classification report

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION

### 4.1 Workflow
1. `load_data()` - Reads CSV
2. `preprocess_data()` - Handles feature scaling
3. `split_data()` - Train/Test split with `random_state=42`
4. `train_model()` - Fits Random Forest
5. `evaluate_model()` - Generates metrics and plots

### 4.2 Example Output
```

Accuracy: 0.872, Precision: 0.853, Recall: 0.891, F1: 0.871

## 5. RESULTS

### 5.1 Performance Metrics
- 🎯 Accuracy: 87.2%
- ✅ Precision: 85.3% (low false positives)
- 🔎 Recall: 89.1% (captured 89% of at-risk students)

### 5.2 Confusion Matrix

| Actual \ Predicted | 0   | 1   |
|--------------------|-----|-----|
| 0                  | 85  | 10  |
| 1                  | 15  | 190 |

### 5.3 Key Predictors
1. GPA
2. Attendance
3. Socio-economic status

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS
- ⚠️ Implement early-warning systems
- 🧑‍🏫 Create targeted tutoring programs
- 📊 Allocate resources based on feature importance

## 7. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. **Prepare** `data.csv` with a `Retention` column

3. **Run model**:

   ```bash
   python education_retention_model.py
   ```

## 8. FUTURE WORK

* 🎯 Add hyperparameter tuning
* 🧠 Include mental health metrics
* 🌐 Develop web interface

## 9. CONCLUSION

This model effectively identifies at-risk students, enabling proactive interventions to improve retention rates.
